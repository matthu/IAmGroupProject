## Deployment

To deploy this project, simply execute the command `npm run deploy`. It will automatically check in your changes to the `gh-pages` deployment branch.

## Issues

If you hit a "JavaScript heap out of memory" error, try to increase the JS memory size with this command in your VSCode terminal:

`export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"`

If you continue to get this error, try increasing the size more or relaunch the project.
